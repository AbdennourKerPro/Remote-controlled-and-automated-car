The material here presented is part of a school project I carried out in College. We created, using a Raspberry Pi and Python, a remote-controlled car with an automatic mode.

I uploaded the Python code controlling the motors through the Raspberry Pi, the HTML/Javascript code of the webpage which allow the control of the robot and the Web Server 
  handling the communication between the interface and the Raspberry Pi.
